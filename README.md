# AES-128 IP Core for Xilinx FPGAs (in VHDL)
My own AES-128 Encryption/Decryption IP Cores in VHDL for Xilinx FPGAs. Cores implement several distinct fast itarative architectures.

Design documents are available in Russian only.

{src/} directory contains only AES-128 encryption IP (one of several implementations). The other implementations are available in {doc/Исходные описания и отчёты}

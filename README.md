# AES-128 IP Cores for Xilinx FPGAs (in VHDL)
My own AES-128 Encryption/Decryption IP Cores in VHDL for Xilinx FPGAs. Cores implement several distinct fast itarative architectures.

{src/} directory contains only AES-128 encryption IP (one of several implementations). The other implementations are available in {doc/Исходные описания и отчёты}.

Design documents are available in Russian only. Please install GOST Type A and GOST Type B fonts to view the documents in a proper way.

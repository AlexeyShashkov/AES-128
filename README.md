# AES-128 IP Core for Xilinx FPGAs (in VHDL)
My own AES-128 Encryption/Decryption IP Core in VHDL for Xilinx FPGAs. Implements a fast itarative architecture: each AES-round takes 1 clock to process data.
Design documents are available in Russian only.

src/ directory contains only AES-128 encryption IP.
Other implementations are available in {doc/Исходные описания и отчёты}

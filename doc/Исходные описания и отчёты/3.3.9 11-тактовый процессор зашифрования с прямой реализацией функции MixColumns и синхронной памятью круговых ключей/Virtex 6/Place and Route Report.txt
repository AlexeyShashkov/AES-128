   "Main" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc6vlx75t, package ff784, speed -3
INFO:Par:338 - 
   Extra Effort Level "c"ontinue is not a runtime optimized effort level. It is intended to be used for designs that are
   not meeting timing but where the designer wants the tools to continue iterating on the design until no further design
   speed improvements are possible.  This can result in very long runtimes since the tools will continue improving the
   design even if the time specs can not be met. If you are looking for the best possible design speed available from a
   long but reasonable runtime use Extra Effort Level "n"ormal.  It will stop iterating on the design when the design
   speed improvements have shrunk to the point that the time specs are not expected to be met.

Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range: 0.000 to 85.000 Celsius)
Initializing voltage to 0.950 Volts. (default - Range: 0.950 to 1.050 Volts)

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

* The fanout is the number of component pins not the individual BEL loads,
for example SLICE loads not FF loads.

Timing Score: 0 (Setup: 0, Hold: 0, Component Switching Limit: 0)

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
